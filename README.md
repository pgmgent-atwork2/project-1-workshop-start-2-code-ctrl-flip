## About this project
This is a memory game where you need to flip cards to find two cards that are the same. The cards all fit into the theme 'programming languages'. Once two cards are flipped, they will be compared with each other. If they are the same, they will remain facing upwards. If they are not the same, the cards will flip around again. Find all pairs to win the game!

Accompanying the memory game is a website that explains how to build the app. This workshop is geared towards (future) students who wants to learn how to code. No prior knowledge is required.
